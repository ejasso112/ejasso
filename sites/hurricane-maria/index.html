            <h2>Hurricane Maria Overview:</h2>
            <p>Hurricane Maria was one of the worst natural disasters that affected Puerto Rico and the U.S
                Virgin Island and also classified one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes to occur since 2004
                after Jeanne. The hurricane originated for the tropical wave and it becomes a tropical storm
                form the east of the Lesser Antilles and it went under explosive intensification on approaching
                the island arc. It was a category 5 hurricane with a sustained wind speed of 175 mph. it causes
                all sort of disaster to the people living in areas that were affected such as shortages in food
                and water, cause the outbreak of water-related diseases, the school closed, hospital destroyed,
                electricity and generator destroyed as well as few generators working running out of fuel. The
                storm left 64-1200 people dead with more than 4, 600 were left I a post-storm recovery that
                faced with the number of complications. In an island like Puerto Rican, there lack reliable and
                sustainable resources of income, food, and power and this has caused many of the residents to
                flee to the mainland U.S. states. The Rican two main economic resources which are tourism and
                agriculture were badly devastated by the storm to an extent that they will take years to
                recover. Since its occurrence, the federal government and the world vision have tried to offer
                some help to people and the Rican resident through a program that offers food and other relief
                items, disaster preparedness training and cash assistance among others.</p>

            <h2>General Science that causes Hurricanes</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A hurricane forms from the heat in the tropical ocean by converting that heat into wind and
                    waves. Hurricanes remove some of the excess tropical heat in the ocean and move it toward the
                    mid-latitudes.</p>

                <h3>Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seawater must be at least 27&deg;C or 80&deg;F</li>
                    <li>Air needs to be warm and humid</li>
                    <li>There must be no wind shear</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hurricanes begin as a cluster of thunderstorms in a low pressure zone.</li>
                    <li>Wind around the thunderstorms gravitate toward the center of the low pressure zone and take
                        warm, humid air up into the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>Through a feedback loop of adiabatic cooling and water vapor condensing, the storm gets
                        stronger.</li>
                    <li>When the winds becomes more circular it is classified as a tropical depression.</li>
                    <li>As the winds become faster and faster wind cannot reach the center and an eye forms instead,
                        this completes the formation of a hurricane.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Science and Geologic Setting behind Hurrican Maria</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>September 12th:</h3>
                <p>Hurricane Maria began as a tropical wave that started in the west coast of Africa</p>

                <h3>September 15th:</h3>
                <p>After three days of movement through the Atlantic Ocean, thunderstorms began organizing and a
                    tropical depression formed the following day near Barbados. Around the same day the movement to
                    a zone of high-pressure area strengthened the formation into a tropical storm.</p>

                <h3>September 17th:</h3>
                <p>Hurricane Maria moved west-northwest and this movement caused its full transformation into a
                    hurricane. The warm temperature of the sea surrounding it, combined with some small vertical
                    shear turned hurricane Maria into a major hurricane.</p>

                <h3>September 19th:</h3>
                <p>Hurricane Maria landed on the island of Dominica as a category 5 hurricane. Although it was
                    weakened by the topography of the Dominica island, it kept moving into the Caribbean Sea.</p>
                <p>Maria became more powerful during its course due to the warmness of the sea it traversed and
                    reached its peak intensity just before hitting Puerto Rico.</p>

                <p>Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century, made landfall on
                    20 September 2017. It compounded destruction caused by hurricane Irma just weeks before.</p>

                <h3>Poverty:</h3>
                <p>More than 44% of the population of Puerto Rico lives in poverty, compared to the national US
                    average of approximately 12%.
                    <br>On 28 August 2018, Puerto Rico’s Governor revised the official death count from 64 to 2,975.</p>

                <h3>Death Count:</h3>
                <p>Prior to that various other studies had estimated the death count to be even higher. US President
                    Trump has denied the numbers.</p>

                <h3>A year After:</h3>
                <p>A year after Maria, tens of thousands in Puerto Rico are still living under blue tarps,
                    designed as temporary roofs. After a Federal Court decision on 30 August, Puerto Ricans
                    temporarily housed in the USA lost FEMA’s housing support on 15 September.</p>

                <h3>Cost:</h3>
                <p>Maria had a $43 billion impact on the U.S. territory’s economy, $1 billion more than originally
                    estimated, according to an island government report. Puerto Rico economist Jose Caraballo said
                    in a phone interview Monday that federal aid and insurance payouts so far have covered only 24%
                    of the losses reported.</p>

                <h3>Recovery:</h3>
                <p>As many as 62% of applicants were denied assistance to rebuild their homes from FEMA, according
                    to one report. Many were refused aid after they were unable to produce the deeds to their homes,
                    a requirement lawyers at Ayuda Legal, a local organization that has helped many residents
                    navigate through FEMA decisions, say is not established in law. While FEMA provides alternatives
                    to verifying ownership, lawyers say that in practice FEMA requirements were onerous and
                    culturally out of touch.</p>
